<h1>Vita</h1>

<p>
Vita is an web-based <code>vi</code> clone that aims to provide a reasonable in-browser experience, especially on devices that don't have arrow keys like the iPhone.
</p> 

<p>
Vita is implemented on top of the HTML <code>textarea</code>.  This differs from related projects (like <a href="http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/">jsvi</a>) in that it only requires a <code>textarea</code> and JavaScript, so it works in very limited environment.
</p>

<p>
It's very early in development, but does allow some basic text editing even now.  Essentially, I'm developing the features I find that I need, but if you're interested in helping out, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:hello@benjaminoakes.com">hello@benjaminoakes.com</a> or via Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/benjaminoakes">@benjaminoakes</a>.
