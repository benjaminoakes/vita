Vita
====

Vita is an web-based `vi`-clone that aims to provide a reasonable in-browser experience, especially on devices that don't have arrow keys like the iPhone.

Vita is implemented on top of the HTML `textarea`.  This differs from related projects (like [jsvi](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/)) in that it only requires a `textarea` and JavaScript, so it works in very limited environment.

It's very early in development, but does allow some basic text editing even now.  Essentially, I'm developing the features I find that I need, but if you're interested in helping out, drop me a line in a GitHub message or via Twitter at @benjaminoakes.
